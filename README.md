Introduction

This repository contains my final project for the course Spatial Analytics in Cultural Data Science. My project is about crime incidents in Washington DC and investigates how these incidents are located througout the county based on spatial data points.

Software Framework

The processes and tasks in this assignment have been conducted using Windows 10 65-bites operating system. All programming is done in R version 4.0.2 64-bits through the IDE RStudio version 1.1.463.  The following packages have been used: “sf”, “tidyverse”, “tmap”, "dplyr" and "leaflet".
